# ERC20 102

## Introduction
Welcome! 
This is an automated workshop that will dive deeper into managing ERC20 tokens. Specifically, we will explore patterns using `approve()` and `transferFrom()`. It is aimed at developers experienced in interacting with and writing smart contracts.

> Note: This workshop is a follow-up to [ERC20 101](https://github.com/Elli610/Blockchain-101/tree/main/workshops/erc20-101). If you haven't completed that workshop, please do so before starting this one.

## How to Work on This TD
The TD has three components:
- An ERC20 token, ticker **TD-ERC20-102**, that is used to keep track of points.
- An evaluator contract that can mint and distribute **TD-ERC20-102** points.
- A claimable ERC20 token, used for issuing tokens and manipulating them.

Your goal is to collect as many **TD-ERC20-102** points as possible. Please note:
- The `transfer` function of **TD-ERC20-102** has been disabled to encourage you to complete the TD with a single address.
- In order to receive points, you will need to execute code in `Evaluator.sol` that triggers `TDERC20.distributeTokens(msg.sender, n);`, distributing `n` points.
- This repo contains an interface `IExerciseSolution.sol`. Your ERC20 contract must conform to this interface to validate the exercises, meaning your contract needs to implement all the functions described in `IExerciseSolution.sol`.
- A high-level description of what's expected for each exercise is in this readme. A detailed description of what's expected can be inferred by reading the code in `Evaluator.sol`.
- The evaluator contract may need to make payments to purchase your tokens. Ensure it has enough ETH to do so. If not, you can send ETH directly to the contract.
- You can use different contracts to validate different exercises. To update the evaluated exercise, call `submitExercise()` in the evaluator contract.

### Getting to Work
- Clone the repo to your machine.
- Install the required packages by running `npm install`.
- Obtain an ethereum API key (from Alchemy, Infura, or any other provider).
- Setup your `.env` file.
- Install and configure a seed phrase or private key for deploying contracts in Hardhat.
- Test your connection to the Holesky network with `npx hardhat console --network holesky`.
- To deploy a contract, create a deployment script in the `scripts/` folder. Look at how the TD is deployed and iterate from there.
- Deploy the contract to the Holesky testnet with `npx hardhat run --network holesky scripts/deploy.ts`.

## Points List
### Setting Up
- Create a Git repository and share it with the teacher.
- Get an API key (from Alchemy, Infura or any other provider) (1 point).
- Install and configure [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)(1 point).
These points will be awarded manually if you're unable to have your contract interact with the evaluator, or automatically when claiming points.
- Manually claim tokens on the claimable ERC20 (1 point).
- Claim your points by calling `ex1_claimedPoints()` in the evaluator (2 points).

### Calling Another Contract from Your Contract
- Create a contract `ExerciseSolution` that can claim tokens from the teacher's ERC20. Keep track of addresses that claimed tokens and how many tokens they claimed in `ExerciseSolution`.
- Deploy `ExerciseSolution` and submit it to the evaluator using `submitExercise()` (1 point).
- Call `ex2_claimedFromContract` in the evaluator to prove your code works (1 point).
- Create a function `withdrawTokens()` in `ExerciseSolution` to withdraw the claimable tokens from `ExerciseSolution` to the address that initially claimed them.
- Call `ex3_withdrawFromContract` in the evaluator to prove your code works (2 points).

### Approve and transferFrom
- Use the ERC20 function to allow your contract to manipulate your tokens. Call `ex4_approvedExerciseSolution()` to claim points (1 point).
- Use ERC20 to revoke this authorization. Call `ex5_revokedExerciseSolution()` to claim points (1 point).
- Create a function `depositTokens()` that allows a user to deposit claimable tokens in `ExerciseSolution` using `transferFrom()`.
- Call `ex6_depositTokens` in the evaluator to prove your code works (2 points).

### Tracking User Deposits with a Deposit Wrapper ERC20
- Create and deploy an ERC20 (`ExerciseSolutionToken`) to track user deposits. This ERC20 should be mintable, with minting authorization given to `ExerciseSolution`.
- Call `ex7_createERC20` in the evaluator to prove your code works (2 points).
- Update the deposit function so that the user's balance is tokenized. When a deposit is made in `ExerciseSolution`, tokens are minted in `ExerciseSolutionToken` and transferred to the address making the deposit.
- Call `ex8_depositAndMint` in the evaluator to prove your code works (2 points).
- Update the `ExerciseSolution` withdraw function to use `transferFrom()` in `ExerciseSolutionToken`, burn these tokens, and return the claimable tokens.
- Call `ex9_withdrawAndBurn` in the evaluator to prove your code works (2 points).
