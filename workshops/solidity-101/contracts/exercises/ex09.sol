Exercice 9: Visualizing code through Github history of commits
In this exercice, you need to:

- Find the last visible version of the contract code
- Use a function 
- Your points are credited by the contract
*/

/*
What you need to know to complete this exercice
A) What was included in the previous exercices
B) The history of contract modification is visible on https://github.com/l-henri/solidity-101
C) Only using the ABI of this contract puts you at risk of not getting the points you deserve
