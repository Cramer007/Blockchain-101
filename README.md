# Blockchain-101
A set of workshop to master blockchain knowledge and programming





This repository is mainly composed of workshops created by [Henri Lieutaud](https://github.com/l-henri), my teacher at ESILV (engineering school in Paris). I have made some modifications to the original workshops to make them more accessible and easier to understand. I also deployed them on new testnets.
