# 🌐 Blockchain-101: Mastering Web3 Knowledge & Blockchain Development

Welcome to **Blockchain-101**, a collection of workshops designed to help you master the world of blockchain, no matter your level of knowledge. Whether you're just discovering Solidity or diving deep into advanced cryptography on the blockchain, DeFi, and account abstraction, there's something here for everyone! 🚀💡

This repository primarily focuses on **Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs)**, but we plan to add support for other blockchain virtual machines in the future. 🌍✨

## 🏆 Earn On-Chain Marks!
We like to keep things practical! For many exercises, there are **on-chain marks** represented by non-transferrable tokens as rewards 🏅. If you receive a mark, it means you successfully completed the associated exercise. 🎉

## 📚 Workshops Overview
This repository contains workshops for all levels, covering topics like:

- 🛠 **Solidity programming** (smart contracts):
  - [Solidity 101](./workshops/solidity-101/) -> An introduction to the Solidity language
  - [ERC20 101](./workshops/erc20-101/) -> Learn to master the ERC20 token basic functions
  - [ERC20 102](./workshops/erc20-102/) -> Dive deeper into managing ERC20 tokens _(Soon!)_
  - NFTs _Coming soon_
- 🔐 **Cryptography** on the blockchain
  - _soon!_

## ✨ About This Repo
Some of the workshops here were created by [Henri Lieutaud](https://github.com/l-henri), my teacher at **ESILV** (an engineering school in Paris). To those workshops, I’ve made some modifications to make the content more accessible and easier to understand. I also deployed them on new testnets to give you hands-on experience! 🔧📘
